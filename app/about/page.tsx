        <p>In the far reaches of the web galaxy, the developer Arthur embarks on a bold mission to create a system powered by intelligent agents and mystical personalities.</p>
        <p>With guidance from the Force — and the <strong>Vercel AI SDK</strong> — he constructs a multi-agent chat experience where each message is enriched with memory, reasoning, and style.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Weather Agent</strong> speaks of distant skies... the <strong>News Agent</strong> brings headlines from across the stars... and <strong>Yoda</strong>, wise and cryptic, guides with timeless truths.</p>
        <p>With voice commands and real-time responses, the system blends speech, sound, and personality, allowing users to talk, listen, and learn as if in a Jedi council.</p>
        <p>Custom themes, animated feedback, and seamless state control mark this new frontier.</p>
        <p>But challenges remain. More agents rise. More conversations await. The saga has only begun...</p>
        <p>May the Source be with you.</p>
